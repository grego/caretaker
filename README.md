A simple tool that loads a list of paths to watch from a TOML file.
```toml
[[watch]]
name = "print hello"
path = "src"
command = "echo \"hello world\""

[[watch]]
name = "compile sass"
path = "sass"
command = "sassc -t compressed sass/style.scss static/style.css"
```
On a change in the `path`, it executes the `command`. Directories are watched recursively.

Using [notify](https://github.com/notify-rs/notify) crate, which provides efficient event handling 
support for the most operating systems (apart from BSD).
